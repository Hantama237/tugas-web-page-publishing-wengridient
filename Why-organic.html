<h2>What are organic products?</h2><br>
The definition of organic products is a product that is produced using
organic farming methods, which limit modern synthetic inputs such as
synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Organic products are
also not processed using irradiation, industrial solvents, or
chemical food additives.The organic agriculture movement emerged
in the 1940s in response to agricultural industrialization which is
now called the Green Revolution. Now various countries in the world
implement food policies such as labeling organic certification so
that a food can be sold to consumers as "organic food ingredients".
With this regulation, organic food must be produced in a manner that
is in accordance with organic standards applied
by the government of a country and international organizations.<br>

<h3 class="advantage-reason">Advantages of organic products</h3>
<h4 class="reason-organic">1.	Fewer pesticides</h4>
Pesticides are chemicals such as fungicides, herbicides and insecticides.
These chemicals are widely used in conventional agriculture, and residues
will remain attached to the food we eat. The rest of this pesticide
cannot even be removed by the washing process, because it can be absorbed
by the roots and deposited in the plants. These pesticide residues are
neurotoxins that poison the nerves. Because it is free of chemicals,
organic food crops are definitely healthier in the long run.<br>

<h4 class="reason-organic">2.	Fresher and last longer</h4>
Organic food is usually fresher and tastier when eaten. These naturally
cultivated foods can also last longer, thus simultaneously minimizing the
use of preservatives.<br>

<h4 class="reason-organic">3.	More nutritious</h4>
In addition to tastier taste, organic food according to research is also
higher in the amount of nutrients. A study reported organic.org showed
that organic fruits and vegetables contained 27% more vitamin C, 21.1%
more iron, 29.3% more magnesium, 13.6% more phosphorus, and 18 % more
polyphenols. Researchers have found that salicylic acid averages 600% in
organic soup, and organic carrot soup contains 1,040 nanograms of
salicylate, compared to non-organic carrot soup which is only
20 nanograms. Organic meat also contains a little saturated fat,
and more is healthy fats.<br>

<h4 class="reason-organic">4.	Does not contain antibiotics</h4>
Organic animals are not given antibiotics, growth hormones, or artificial
foods from side ingredients / waste. The use of antibiotics in the
production of broiler livestock will create new strains of bacteria
that are resistant to antibiotics. This means that when a person falls ill
because of this strain, he will respond less to antibiotic treatment.<br>

<h4 class="reason-organic">5.	Not genetically engineered</h4>
With the advancement of technology, genetic engineering for food has now
become commonplace to increase production. The study said that mice in the
laboratory that were given genetically modified corn developed tumors in
brain and eventually died. Organic food is the only food that is free
from crosses.<br>

<h4 class="reason-organic">6.	Organic farming is more environmentally friendly</h4>
Organic farming has been shown to reduce pollution (air, water and soil),
save water, reduce erosion, increase soil fertility, and use less energy.
In addition, organic farming is better for ecosystems that are nearby.
Agriculture without pesticides is also safer for farmers who manage
food production.<br>
