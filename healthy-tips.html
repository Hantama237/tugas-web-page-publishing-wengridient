					<h2 class="tips-title">Healthy Tips</h2>
					<p>
					Health is a priceless treasure. Therefore to stay healthy people are willing to do anything.
					All methods carried out both medical and non-medical, from the logical to the supernatural,
					 are various efforts carried out by many people from various circles to always be healthy or regain their health.<br>
					Not infrequently the way done is to spend a lot of money and even sometimes it is not uncommon to hit various norms and logic.
					But actually maintaining yourself to stay healthy is not difficult, even sometimes it doesn't require any money at all.
					But of course it takes extra patience and patience that only a few people can to consistently undergo.
					 Here we present 10 healthy ways of life that can be used as references to stay healthy and always happy in living life.
					Next is his presentation.<br>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Increase consumption of water</b><br>
							Did you know that most of us often don't drink enough water every day? This is
							certainly not a good thing because as we know water is very important for our body.
							 This is because we lose water every day through urine, bowel movements, sweat and
							breathing, so we need to fill our water intake. A study shows the amount of water we need depends on various factors.<br>
							Such as climate and weather conditions, physical activity we do, and weight, but
							 generally we need 2.7 to 3.7 liters of water intake. If signs appear like for example;
							urine colored or rather yellow, dry lips, dry mouth and slight urination. Immediately
							drink water because of the signs that appear because the body begins to lack fluids.</li>
						<li><b>Sleep and get enough rest</b><br>
							Sleep and adequate rest is one of the keys to healthy living habits. This is
							very reasonable because the body really needs rest to be able to return to maximum activity.
							But if you don't rest well, you can compensate by eating more, but this is not
							recommended by health experts. Enough rest and sleep also prevent premature aging.</li>
						<li><b>Meditation</b><br>
							Meditation calms the mind and soothes the soul. Peace alone is very beneficial for
							health because it can keep us away from stress which is a source of many diseases and health problems.</li>
						<li><b>Regular exercise</b><br>
							Research has shown that exercising every day brings tremendous benefits to our health,
							including increased life span, reduced risk of disease, higher bone density and weight loss.
							If you don't have time to exercise or go to a fitness center, walk or daily activities such
							as choosing to go up stairs and open an elevator, it will be an easy and inexpensive substitute for sports activities.</li>
						<li><b>Do exercise as part of pleasure</b><br>
							When you enjoy sports, you will naturally want to do it. Because forced exercise will cause suffering
							instead of causing you to continue to do it but instead become lazy. So choose the sport you like and do it regularly.</li>
						<li><b>Eat more fruit</b><br>
							Eat more fruit and reduce synthetic vitamins. There are many types of fruit that can be consumed which in
							addition to healthy as well it feels guaranteed good.</li>
						<li><b>Eat more vegetables</b><br>
							Like fruits, vegetables are important for our health. Experts suggest that we should at least consume 5-9
							servings of fruits / vegetables, every day. The bad news is that most people don't like to consume vegetables,
							and this is certainly not a good thing for our health.</li>
						<li><b>Choose brightly colored foods as antioxidants</b><br>
							Fruits and vegetables with bright colors are usually high in anti-oxidants. Anti-oxidants are needed by
							the body because they eliminate and counteract free radicals in our body which can damage the cells of our body.
							So maybe you need to start consuming vegetables and fruits with different colors, like for example; white (Banana, mushroom),
							Yellow (Pineapple, Mango), Orange (Orange, Papaya), Red (Apple, Strawberry, Tomato, Watermelon), Green (Guava, Avocado, Cucumber,
							Lettuce, Celery), Purple / Blue (Fruit Berry, Eggplant, Plum Fruit). This Color Diet is also good at maintaining a healthy diet
							and forming an ideal body.</li>
						<li><b>Reduce processed foods and canned foods</b><br>
							Processed or canned foods should be avoided for various reasons such as; nutritional value that is often not perfect,
							there are added preservatives which can have a negative impact on health, if consumed continuously and over a long period of time.
							Even the addition of salt must be considered before consuming processed or canned foods too often.
						<li><b>Get to know food triggers, control sugar and salt intake</b><br>
							Consuming excessive sugar and salt can interfere with your health, even though you still need to consume the right amount of sugar and salt.<br></li>
					</ol>
